Pro add-on of the popular Auto Image Attributes From Filename With Bulk Updater WordPress plugin.

== Description ==

Automatically add Image attributes such as Image Title, Image Caption, Description And Alt Text from Image Filename. 

The plugin can update image attributes for both new images and existing images in the media library.

With this plugin you can:

* Set the image filename as the image Title.
* Set the image filename as the image Caption.
* Set the image filename as the image Description.
* Set the image filename as the image Alt Text. This was a default feature in WordPress before 4.7. The plugin restores this essential feature which is great for SEO.
